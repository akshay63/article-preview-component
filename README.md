## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

In this project, I have used SASS and tried to use most of its useful and recent features.

### Continued development

There are still improvements needed as far as using SASS fully and in animation section too.
